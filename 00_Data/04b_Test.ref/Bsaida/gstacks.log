Read 176080956 BAM records:
  kept 108700425 primary alignments (64.9%), of which 55148515 reverse reads
  skipped 23692995 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (14.2%)
  skipped 19738135 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (11.8%)
  skipped 15253799 unmapped reads (9.1%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 6772344.5 records/sample (955831-19698491)
    kept 57.7%-64.6% of these

Built 259136 loci comprising 53551910 forward reads and 48638438 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 207.6 (sd: 49.1).

Genotyped 259136 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=30.8x, stdev=17.2x, min=5.7x, max=86.5x
  mean number of sites per locus: 197.5
  a consistent phasing was found for 128413 of out 152499 (84.2%) diploid loci needing phasing
