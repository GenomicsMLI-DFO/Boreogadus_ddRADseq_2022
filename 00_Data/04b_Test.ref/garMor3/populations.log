SNPs and calls will be written in VCF format to './00_Data/04b_Test.ref/populations.snps.vcf'
Raw haplotypes will be written to './00_Data/04b_Test.ref/populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './00_Data/04b_Test.ref/populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './00_Data/04b_Test.ref/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Removed 219107 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 273141 loci.
Kept 54034 loci, composed of 11956846 sites; 27229 of those sites were filtered, 43541 variant sites remained.
    11745426 genomic sites, of which 209412 were covered by multiple loci (1.8%).
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 216.09bp (stderr 0.23).
