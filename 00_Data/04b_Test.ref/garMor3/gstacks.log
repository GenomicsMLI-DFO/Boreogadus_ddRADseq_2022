Read 182366943 BAM records:
  kept 108374857 primary alignments (64.7%), of which 55719237 reverse reads
  skipped 32144171 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (19.2%)
  skipped 22478010 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (13.4%)
  skipped 4388316 unmapped reads (2.6%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 7014113.2 records/sample (987561-20392316)
    kept 55.9%-62.6% of these

Built 273141 loci comprising 52655620 forward reads and 46124713 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 206.1 (sd: 52.6).

Genotyped 273141 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=29.4x, stdev=16.1x, min=5.7x, max=81.6x
